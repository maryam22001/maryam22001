## 🏅 About Me

I am a results-driven DevOps & Software Engineer with a passion for cloud technologies, automation, and resilient systems.  
I've delivered measurable business impact—such as reduced deployment times and increased system reliability—by building cloud-native applications (AWS, Kubernetes), codifying and automating infrastructure (Terraform, Docker), and driving modern CI/CD adoption.  
Currently, I am seeking impactful opportunities to push the boundaries in Go, Python, and scalable cloud engineering.
