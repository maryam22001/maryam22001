Hi there, I'm Maryam 👋

⚡ Junior Software Engineer & DevOps Enthusiast

Automation for Excellence, Reliability at Scale!

💼 About Me

I am a motivated Software Engineer and DevOps Practitioner with a strong foundation in building scalable cloud applications and automating infrastructure.

I focus on bridging the gap between development and operations by:

☁️ Architecting cloud-native systems on AWS & Kubernetes.

🤖 Codifying infrastructure with Terraform & Ansible.

🔄 Implementing CI/CD principles to increase developer productivity.

I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in Go, Python, and Cloud Engineering to solve real-world problems.
